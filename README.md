# 🧠 Basics of Python (20 Folder Journey)

This folder contains **my complete Python foundation**, organized into 20 folders.  
Each folder covers one concept, includes multiple practical `.py` programs, and a `README.md` file with clear explanations.

This entire base is designed to help me:
- Build strong core Python skills
- Prepare for AI/ML development
- Solve interview questions confidently
- Revisit any concept instantly using folder-based breakdown

## 🎯 Why this matters for AI/ML

- All data preprocessing is done using these foundations (list, dict, loops, functions)
- Libraries like Pandas and scikit-learn depend on Python core logic
- Writing clean, scalable ML pipelines needs functions, decorators, generators
- Model configs and results are stored in JSON
- Deployment needs error handling, environment setup, file I/O, threading
