ðŸ§¹ How to safely delete your virtual environment:

1. Deactivate the env (if active):
   $ deactivate

2. Delete the "venv" folder:
   - On Windows: Delete venv directory manually
   - On Unix/macOS:
     $ rm -rf venv/

NOTE: This will NOT uninstall any global packages â€” only the isolated environment is removed.
