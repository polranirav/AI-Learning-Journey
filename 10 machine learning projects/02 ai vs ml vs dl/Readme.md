# 🤖 Project 2: AI vs ML vs DL – Understanding the Hierarchy

This folder breaks down the **core differences between Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)** — with real-world examples and beginner-friendly analogies. It’s crucial for interviews and building strong foundational understanding.

        "Easier to train and debug",
        "Examples: Spam filter, price prediction"
    ],
    "Deep Learning": [
        "Needs large data (millions of images or audio)",
        "Great for unstructured data (text, image, video)",
        "Harder to explain, but very powerful",
        "Examples: Face recognition, speech-to-text, GPT"

## 🧠 Real-World AI/ML Relevance

| Term | Role in AI Systems |
|------|--------------------|
| AI   | The goal – mimic human intelligence |
| ML   | The method – learn from data |
| DL   | The tool – deep neural networks for big data tasks |

**Example:** A self-driving car uses:
- AI → Planning route, reacting to traffic
- ML → Learning from user driving behavior
- DL → Vision system to detect pedestrians, signs

## 💬 Interview Prep

1. What’s the difference between AI, ML, and DL?
2. When would you use ML vs DL?
3. Is DL always better than traditional ML?
4. Give 3 real-world DL applications.

## ✅ Tip

> Think of AI as the *destination*, ML as the *vehicle*, and DL as the *rocket engine* for big complex problems.
