# 🔗 Pandas Merge and Join – Combining Datasets for AI Pipelines

This folder teaches you how to combine multiple DataFrames — a common task in real AI/ML workflows like joining predictions with labels, merging features, or stacking experiment results.

---

## 📌 Programs in This Folder

### 1. `1_merge_datasets.py`

Covers:
- `pd.merge()` with `on="id"` using `inner`, `outer`, `left` joins
- Equivalent to SQL joins

Used in:
- Joining predictions with ground truth
- Matching metadata with labels

---

### 2. `2_merge_on_multiple_keys.py`

Covers:
- Merge on two or more columns (e.g., `id` + `version`)
- Composite key joins

Used in:
- Versioned datasets
- Time-windowed sensor logs
- Matching env-dependent records

---

### 3. `3_concat_dataframes.py`

Covers:
- `pd.concat()` for vertical and horizontal stacking
- Axis=0 → stack rows; Axis=1 → stack columns

Used in:
- Combining batches of predictions
- Model ensemble outputs
- Merging feature columns from different sources

---

### 4. `4_join_vs_merge.py`

Covers:
- `.join()` vs. `pd.merge()` differences
- Index-based vs. column-based joining

Used in:
- Logs with matching index
- Quick joins in metrics and evaluation files

## 🧠 Real-World Relevance in AI/ML

| Merge Type         | Use Case |
|--------------------|----------|
| `merge(inner)`     | Evaluate only matched predictions |
| `merge(outer)`     | Full audit of predictions + labels |
| `merge(on=[id, version])` | Multi-key joins for versioned models |
| `concat(axis=0)`   | Stack rows (batches) together |
| `concat(axis=1)`   | Combine predictions side-by-side |
| `.join()`          | Combine logs or indexed tables |

## 💬 Interview Questions

1. What’s the difference between `merge()` and `join()` in Pandas?
2. How do you merge two datasets on multiple columns?
3. What does `concat()` do and how is it different from merge?
4. When would you use an outer join in ML?

## ✅ Tip

> Always check for missing values or duplicate rows after merges — especially in model evaluations.
