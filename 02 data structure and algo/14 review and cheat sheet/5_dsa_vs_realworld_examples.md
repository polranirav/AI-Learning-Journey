# 🤖 DSA vs Real-World AI/ML Use Cases

This guide maps core data structures and algorithms to **practical machine learning, NLP, and AI engineering tasks**.

## 📦 Data Structures

| Concept        | Real AI/ML Use Case |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `List`         | Store predictions, batch text/tokens |
| `Dict`         | Token to index mapping, label lookup |
| `Set`          | Remove duplicate tokens, track seen items |
| `Tuple`        | Coordinates, frozen hyperparameters |
| `Stack`        | Backtracking (search, undo steps) |
| `Queue`        | Batch jobs, token streaming |
| `Tree`         | Decision Trees, parse trees, XML/json |
| `Graph`        | Attention heads, token connections, KG |
| `Matrix`       | Image pixels, word embeddings, confusion matrix |
| `LinkedList`   | Rare — stream-like memory-efficient data chain |

## 🔍 Searching Algorithms

| Algorithm       | AI Task / System |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Linear Search   | Fallback scan in prediction results |
| Binary Search   | Lookup in sorted token score list |
| Dict/Set Search | Token/label search (`O(1)`) |
| BFS             | Layer-wise token decoding, graph traversal |
| DFS             | Deep walk in decision rules or tree parsing |

## 🔃 Sorting in Practice

| Sort Pattern                 | Use Case |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| Sort list of dicts          | Rank models by accuracy |
| Sort by multiple keys       | Sort logs by score and timestamp |
| Stable sort                 | Preserve model insert order with same score |
| Custom key sort (`lambda`)  | Sort models by loss, f1, etc. |

## 📐 Recursion + Dynamic Programming

| Problem         | Real Use Case |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Climb stairs    | Token generation / sequence decode paths |
| Fibonacci       | Predicting recursive patterns |
| Subset sum      | Feature selection / binary decision modeling |
| Sequence decode | NLP encoding/decoding logic |
| Memoization     | Caching repeated model inference |
| Tabulation      | Time-efficient decoding / RL reward planning |

## 🔁 When to Use What (Quick Table)

| Problem Type                        | Use |
|-------------------------------------|-----|
| Fast lookup                         | `dict`, `set` |
| Avoid duplicates                    | `set` |
| Sort ranked outputs                 | `sorted()`, `key=lambda` |
| Traverse text tree or tokens        | `DFS`, `BFS` |
| Find path or relationship between tokens | `graph`, `BFS/DFS` |
| Generate multiple sequence paths    | `DP`, recursion |
| Track visited or backtrack          | `stack`, `set` |
| Rank models by performance          | `sort dict/list of dicts` |
| Decode structured input             | `tree`, `DP`, `memoization` |

## ✅ Final Tip

> DSA isn't about memorizing theory — it's about choosing the **right tool for the job**.  
> As an AI engineer, think:  
> **“How is this structure helping me build better pipelines or smarter models?”**
