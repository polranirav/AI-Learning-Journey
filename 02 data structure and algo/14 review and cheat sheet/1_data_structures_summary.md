## ✅ Core Python Data Structures

| Type         | Description                                | AI/ML Use Case Example |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `List`       | Ordered, mutable sequence                  | Store predictions, label arrays |
| `Tuple`      | Ordered, immutable sequence                | Coordinate pairs, frozen model configs |
| `Set`        | Unordered, unique values                   | Remove duplicate classes or tokens |
| `Dict`       | Key-value pairs                            | Token-to-ID mapping, label-score tracking |
| `String`     | Immutable text sequence                    | Raw text, token strings |
| `Queue`      | FIFO structure                             | Batch jobs in inference pipelines |
| `Stack`      | LIFO structure                             | Backtracking in search/tree problems |
| `LinkedList` | Node-based, dynamic memory usage           | Rare, but useful in stream-like traversal |
| `Tree`       | Hierarchical node structure                | Decision Trees, parse trees, XML/JSON parsing |
| `Graph`      | Nodes connected by edges                   | Attention layers, knowledge graphs |
| `Matrix`     | 2D list or numpy array                     | Confusion matrix, images, embeddings |

## 🧠 Real-World Mapping (ML/NLP)

| Concept             | Use Case in ML |
|---------------------|----------------|
| `List`              | Output of predictions, batch storage |
| `Dict`              | Tokenizer vocab, label-to-index maps |
| `Set`               | Unique token extraction, filtering |
| `Graph`             | Attention heads, dependency parse |
| `Tree`              | Decision trees, expression parsing |
| `Matrix`            | Image data, word embeddings |

## 🔁 Quick Pick Guide

| Situation                               | Use |
|----------------------------------------|-----|
| You need fast lookup (O(1))            | `dict`, `set` |
| You care about order                   | `list`, `tuple` |
| You need to avoid duplicates           | `set` |
| You need structured branching logic    | `tree` |
| You need to model token interactions   | `graph` |
| You need key-value relationships       | `dict` |
| You want fast queueing or batch flow   | `deque`, `queue.Queue` |

## ✅ Tip

> Start with `list`, `dict`, and `set` — they cover 80% of real-world AI problems.  
> Use `graph` and `tree` when structure or relationships matter.
