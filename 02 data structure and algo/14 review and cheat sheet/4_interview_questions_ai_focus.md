# ðŸ§  AI-Focused DSA Interview Questions (With Short Answers)

This file summarizes the most important interview questions relevant to **AI/ML roles**, along with short, real-world answers.

## ðŸ”¹ Python & Logic Fundamentals

1. **What is the difference between a list and a tuple?**  
   â†’ List = mutable, Tuple = immutable. Use tuples when values shouldn't change (e.g., config).

2. **How does a dictionary work internally?**  
   â†’ Uses a hash table. Keys are hashed for constant-time (`O(1)`) access.

3. **How would you remove duplicates from a list of predictions?**  
   â†’ Use `set()`: `list(set(my_list))` or loop with `seen = set()`.

4. **Whatâ€™s the difference between `is` and `==` in Python?**  
   â†’ `is` checks memory location (identity), `==` checks value.

5. **What happens if you modify a list while iterating over it?**  
   â†’ Can lead to skipped or duplicated values. Always iterate over a copy: `my_list[:]`.

## ðŸ”¹ Searching

1. **When would you use binary search instead of linear search?**  
   â†’ Binary for sorted data (O(log n)); linear for small/unsorted data (O(n)).

2. **How does Pythonâ€™s `in` behave differently for a list vs. a set?**  
   â†’ `list`: O(n), slow for large data. `set`: O(1), fast lookup using hashing.

3. **How do you find the index of a specific token in a list?**  
   â†’ Use `.index(token)` â€” returns the first match or raises `ValueError`.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Sorting

1. **How do you sort a list of dictionaries by accuracy?**  
   â†’ `sorted(models, key=lambda x: x['acc'], reverse=True)`

2. **What is a stable sort? Why does it matter?**  
   â†’ Preserves original order of equal elements â€” useful in tie-breaking.

3. **How do you sort by multiple keys?**  
   â†’ Use tuple: `sorted(data, key=lambda x: (-x['acc'], x['name']))`

## ðŸ”¹ Graphs & Trees

1. **What is BFS and where is it used?**  
   â†’ Level-wise traversal using a queue. Used in NLP, token graphs, shortest path.

2. **BFS vs DFS (traversal/memory)?**  
   â†’ BFS = queue, wide search, more memory. DFS = stack/recursion, deep search.

3. **How is a decision tree represented in memory?**  
   â†’ Tree of nodes with left/right children, often as nested dicts or classes.

4. **How can you detect a cycle in a graph?**  
   â†’ Use DFS + recursion stack or visited set.

5. **How are graphs used in transformers?**  
   â†’ Attention mechanisms are graphs: tokens attend (connect) to others.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Recursion & DP

1. **Recursion vs Dynamic Programming?**  
   â†’ Recursion solves problems by breaking them down.  
   â†’ DP adds memoization/tabulation to avoid recomputation.

2. **Why is memoization fast?**  
   â†’ Caches previously computed results; avoids duplicate work.

3. **Tabulation vs Recursion?**  
   â†’ Tabulation = bottom-up (iterative), recursion = top-down. Tab = stack-safe.

4. **Climb stairs = NLP decode?**  
   â†’ Yes, both are step-based decisions: from 1â†’n tokens or states.

5. **What is a subproblem?**  
   â†’ A smaller instance of the problem you're solving â€” core to DP logic.

## ðŸ”¹ Real-World Case Studies

1. **How would you build a model leaderboard?**  
   â†’ Use a list of dicts â†’ sort by accuracy â†’ show top-N.

2. **Need to deduplicate large dataset â€” what to use?**  
   â†’ Use a `set()` or dict â€” fast and memory-efficient.

3. **How would you map tokens to embeddings?**  
   â†’ Use a dictionary (token â†’ ID), then use index to get embedding.

4. **Same function input used repeatedly â€” what to do?**  
   â†’ Use `@lru_cache` or memoization to store and reuse output.

## âœ… Tip

> In AI/ML interviews, they test how you **apply logic**, not just write code.  
> Master **why** to use a data structure â€” thatâ€™s 90% of the win.
